# Sudoku Solver

Welcome to the Sudoku Solver project This project demonstrates how to build a smart Sudoku solver using Python and explores advanced AI techniques to optimize the solution process.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle. The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contain all the digits from 1 to 9. This project implements a basic Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm and discusses potential AI enhancements.

## ðŸ§  Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: The solver uses a simple backtracking approach to fill in the grid with valid numbers.
- **Heuristic Enhancements**: Strategies to optimize the solver's efficiency by choosing the next cell and number smartly.
- **Advanced AI Techniques** (Future Work):
  - Constraint Propagation
  - Machine Learning (Supervised and Reinforcement Learning)
  - Optimization Algorithms (Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
